                    <h5>How did the process over product concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
                    <p>Process over product is LIFE! This sprint took longer as I enjoyed the process "and played" a lot.</p>
                    <p>The skeleton docs weren't helpful so it forced me to really explore and build from scratch.  This experience I am greatful for.</p>
                    <p>There is still a lot to fix on my site and I know I'll be able to do that as I continue learning.</p>
                <h5>What did you think about meditation before chapter 2?</h5>
                    <p>Meditation for myself is an opportunity to connect with my creator and reflect.</p>
                    <p>Before reading chapter 2 I was already familiar with all the content covered about meditation.  I have found my own way of meditating that works for me and am really greatful to be able to confidently share that statement.</p>
                    <p>Keep the best and leave the rest.  One person's view may not be the same as yours so just take what does work for you and keep moving forward in line with your own values and beliefs.</p>
                <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                    <p>I need to meditate more than I do.</p>
                <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                    <p>I liked the "Let it go" technique - while Frozen plays in my head as I read "Let it go"</p>
                    <p>Letting go is not forcing something to go away.  Instead, letting go is an invitation.</p>
