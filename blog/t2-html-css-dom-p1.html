        Design and structural features I liked that I may want to use in my designs next sprint.
        - Modals were so much fun to discover and I am looking forward to using them.
        - Grid structures and setting up the page to be responsive to all devices was good to learn.
        - I will probably use the placehold.it images when creating as well.    </p>
    <p> Describe HTML, CSS and DOM
        My sister in law is pregnant with her first baby.  "Gender reveal" parties were non existent when we were pregnant.  All 4 times :-)
        In organising her gender reveal party she had to get the doctor to write the gender on a piece of paper so that it will remain a secret until the reveal. 
        That paper was then passed onto the baker, balloon and colour popper person so they could make the creations for the reveal.
        So, on the big day of the reveal we all played games, placed bets and got excited with the anticipation of guessing the gender of our new addition.
        The bro and sis took centre stage with the colour poppers as we counted down.  The sky was filled with an eplosion of pink and loud 'yahoos'.
        HTML - is the piece of paper written by the doctor.  Communicating the correct message so that the baker makes the correct colour filling.
               HTML is the message given to the internet of what your we page should look like.
        CSS - is the big "It's a girl sign that appeared after the colour bomb"  CSS adds style and structure to the web page.
        DOM - is the relationships.  As the parents are now having a child so too do the relationships within the structure of a web page also exist.  Child elements belonging to parent elements.
    <p> 
        What is meant by boxifying design? Setting up the web page into a series of boxes to make it easier to read and understand.
        What is the box model?  Container, Margin, Border, Padding then Content - This is what makes up the HTML element on the page.
