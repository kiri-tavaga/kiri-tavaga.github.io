                        <h5>Trust and Sincerity</h5>
                            <p>Give people the benefit of the doubt... Trust begets trust and simply treating others who you want to be treated sums it up.</p>
                            <p>Have I used any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?  I practice the three points above. </p>
                            <p>Empathetic listening is helpful and very worthwhile in my line of work and also as a parent.</p>
                            <p>Loving kindness meditation exercise didn't work for me. </p>
                            <p>Political awareness exercise was difficult.  Trying to make excuses for someone elses behaviour was hard because the fact is some people are just unreasonable and terrible human beings.</p>
                            <p>On a happier note... it wasn't an organisation or place of work.</p>
