                        <h5>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time when you:-</h5>
                        <h5>1. Got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
                            <p>When using the command line I was trying to push content to a repository that didn't exist.  It took me a long time to realise the simple mistake of missing out the first step in cloning the repository to the command line.  I did a lot of mistakes in trial and error thinking the problem was with the command line or branch.  In this mistake I learnt a great deal about the command line and how to navigate through a problem when my knowledge and skills are limited.</p>
                        <h5>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
                            <p>An elegant solution, often referred to in relation to problems in disciplines such as mathematics, engineering, and programming, is one in which the maximum desired effect is achieved with the smallest, or simplest effort.  I can't say that I have done this yet.</p>
                        <h5> How confident do you feel about using the problem solving techniques and processes?</h5>
                            <p>Pseudocode - I need more practice.</p>
                            <p>Trying something - tends to be my preferred problem solving technique.</p>
                            <p>Reading error messages, console.logging and asking for help are also areas that I need to improve in.</p>
