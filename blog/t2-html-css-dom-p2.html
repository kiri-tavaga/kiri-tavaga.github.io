    What is grid based design? Designing the page according to a grid of 12 columns.  This helps to organise and section off information so that it is easier to read and understand the information.
    What's all the hype about responsive web pages?  Responsive feature allows the design and contents to adjust to the device and screen accessing the website.
    What is semantic structure? Introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation, such as using tags and indentations.
