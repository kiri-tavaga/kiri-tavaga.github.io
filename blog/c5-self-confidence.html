                        <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h5>
                            <p>Being present allows you to develop self-awareness competencies.</p>
                        <h5>Try one of the self-awareness practices.</h5>
                            <p>I like journalling.  My learning style is writing and my love language is also words so journalling is naturally my preferred option of practicing self-awareness.</p>
                        <h5>What did you take away from the my emotions are not me section?</h5>
                            <p>Being able to see emotions as just something your body is experiencing allows you to detatch from seeing emotions as your identity and lead to empowering yourself to control the effects of those emotions.  Not letting emotions determine your actions.</p>
