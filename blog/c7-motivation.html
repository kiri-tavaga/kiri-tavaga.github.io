                        <h5>How does life look through the pleasure, passion and purpose lens?</h5>
                            <p>Pleasure - Always chasing the next high</p>
                            <p>Passion - Peak performance meets peak engagement</p>
                            <p>Purpose - Being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you</p>
                            <p>I find that I have a good balance of operating first from purpose and everything I do is in service to others (my purpose).</p>
                            <p>Having purpose definitely helps me to love what I do, even learning new things that are hard is easier because I'm not doing it for myself.</p>
                            <p>The pleasure in my life is definitely tied in with my passion and purpose so chasing the next high for me and my family is travel.</p>
                            <p>Our motto has and always will be... "Work hard, play harder"</p>
                        <h5>Discovering values and higher purpose</h5>
                            <p>My core values flow from loving the Lord with all my heart, soul and mind.</p>
                            <p>What do you stand for? Everything that is important to Him is important to me.</p>
                        <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
                            <p>I liked the metaphor for Inner Calm being like a deep sea... though it may be choppy on the surface it is still calm underneath.</p>
                            <p>Emotional and cognitive resilience for me highlighted my need to celebrate the emotions of success and always be optimistic.</p>
