                        <h5>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                            <p>Javascript is way more complex to learn because it can do some much more.  JS can bring movement to a picture and functionality to a command (ie. passwords/logins)</p>
                        <h5>Explain control flow and loops from everyday life examples.</h5>
                            <p>Control Flow - if/else if : Checks the condition is true or false then follows with a direction.  My everyday life involves 4 little humans so control flow would be like me asking my kids if they have done their chores before turning on the tv in the morning.  I would then check to see if their answer is true or false.  If they have told me the truth then they can watch tv and if their answer is false they will have extra chores to complete before we drop them off to school.</p>
                            <p>Loops - while: checks statement and follows direction continuously until the answer returns differently to the expected statement.  Since the daily struggle of getting the kids ready for school is continuous I will use this example again to explain loops.  Every morning my kids race to ask me if they can turn the tv on because all their chores are done.  As long as their statement is true everyday they will be allowed this privelege.  The day this statement is false or they fail to ask for permission will result in a break to the loop and a new direction being given.  No TV and extra chores.</p>
                        <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
                            <p>Arrays and objects helps you to store data.  The best way to organise and store data is determined by the purpose of each structure.  Use arrays when order is the most important factor for organising the information e.g A book has chapters (ordered).</p>
                            <p>Use objects when Data Label is most important.  Like a newspaper is split into sections this is a good representation of how an object organises stored data.  To get to the business section you would simply find it by searching newspaper.business </p>
                        <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful?</h5>
                            <p>A function is a type of procedure or routine.  (code that performs a specific task)</p>
                            <p>Functions are reusable, can separate tasks, can be shared and helps with testing and debugging. </p>
