    <p>
    which timebox and habits techniques did you try? None on this sprint as this was the last assignment I looked at before completing sprint 1.
    What did you find interesting? I really liked Forget big change, start with a tiny habit.  The counterintuitive article didn't agree with how I'm wired which I found interesting to reflect on for mtyself.
    What worked for you? I find meditation or centreing myself is key.  Balance with work and family is important for myself to be in the zone.
    Which will you experiment further with? Pomodoro technique and timeboxing will be something I try in the next sprint, as well as forming tiny habits.</p>

    Recognise that I am in danger of having an immediately huge vision which could lead to failure.  Explore the habits of successful people starting small.  Make my vision smaller so that it's more likely to succeed.<p>
