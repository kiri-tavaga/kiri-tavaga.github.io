                <h2>Sherif's video discussion</h2>
                <h3>8 August 2018</h3>
                <p>What's your take on DBC/EDA experience?  I don't have one. <br>
                  What are your impressions? I like the creator mindset and the analogy of learning <br>
                  an instrument before being able to play it with creativity and practiced skill. <br>
                  How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? I hope I take Sherif's advice <br>
                  to prepare as much as possible and form relationships with others before bootcamp.<br>
                  Have your expectations of EDA changed?  No.<br>
                  Excited to participate? Definitely.  I am ready to learn. </p>
                <p>I liked the restaurant and kitchen analogy of learners experience and expectations. <br>
                   I also liked the bootcamp being a transformational right of passage.</p>
                <p>Personal Goal - Articulate problems so that other humans can understand in order for <br>
                  me to engage in learning from others and not become a cowboy coder</p>
