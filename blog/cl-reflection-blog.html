    <p>
    What's your take on DBC/EDA experience?  I don't have one.
    What are your impressions? I like the creator mindset and the analogy of learning an instrument before being able to play it with creativity and practiced skill.
    How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? I hope I take Sherif's advice to prepare as much as possible and form relationships with others before bootcamp.
    Have your expectations of EDA changed?  No.
    Excited to participate? Definitely.  I am ready to learn. </p>
    <p>
      I liked the restaurant and kitchen analogy of learners experience and expectations.  I also liked the bootcamp being a transformational right of passage.

    Personal Goal - Articulate problems so that other humans can understand in order for me to engage in learning from others and not become a cowboy coder.
