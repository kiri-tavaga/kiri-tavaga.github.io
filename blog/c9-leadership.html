                    <h5>What is your experience of compassionate leadership?</h5>
                    <p>Cognitive component: "I understand you"</p>
                    <p>Affective component: "I feel for you"</p>
                    <p>Motivational component: "I want to help you"</p>
                    <p>I have had great compassionate leaders in my life that modelled the above three components from their hearts and not really their minds as the suggested training methods in the book.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of who you are "helping/leading" that person is going to know if you are "real".  In my experience I choose to lead compassionately from my heart so that every moment shared with each other (because it's reciprocal-not just one way) has meaning and purpose.</p>
                <h5>Multiplying Goodness</h5>
                    <p>Taking a moment to remember my compassionate leaders and appreciate the values they have sown in me was a worthwhile exercise.</p>
                <h5>Tonglen Meditation</h5>
                    <p>Didn't really work for me.</p>
                <h5>SCARF model in Phase 0 and application at Bootcamp</h5>
                    <p>Status - Not comparing myself to others and just going at my own pace in my own way has helped.</p>
                    <p>Certainty - Don't sweat the small stuff.  I find I compartmentalise things I have to deal with and can park things when necessary.</p>
                    <p>Autonomy - Believing you are in control till you find that you're actually not.  The feeling of helplessness in the face of stress.</p>
                    <p>This is where my support system is invaluable.  My God, My husband and children, My friends - basically my important relationships that will reassure me that everything is going to be OK.</p>
                    <p>Relatedness - Friend or Foe... Coming from a small town even strangers are friends and whakawhanaungatanga is usually the first topic of conversion.  The desire to know how we are connected.</p>
                    <p>Fairness - Explained in the book is more like pride and ego.  I am all for justice and treating others how you want to be treated.  There is no room for ego when you put others first.</p>
                <h5>Difficult conversation</h5>
                    <p>I tend to use the sandwich technique (something positive, the issue and it's effects, then something positive) or ... When you, I felt, Can we.</p>
                    <p>Both of these approaches have helped with all difficult conversations.</p>
