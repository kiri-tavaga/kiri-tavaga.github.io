                        <h5>What is Scope?</h5>
                            <p>Javascript has two scopes, global and local. </p>
                            <p>Scope refers to the accessibility of variables declared in Javascript. </p>
                            <p>Every function has it's own territory.  If javascript was the planet Earth, a function would be a country.</p>
                            <p>Variables declared outside of functions are known as global scopes, which can be used anywhere in the Javascript code. </p>
                            <p>Variables declared inside functions are known as local scopes, meaning they are local to the function they are declared in and can only be used inside of that function.</p>
                            <p>Variables declared inside of the country/function can be accessed only by that country/function.</p>
