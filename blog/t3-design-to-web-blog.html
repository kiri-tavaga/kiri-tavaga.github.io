            <h1>Design to Web</h1>
            <h5>What is a responsive site and why responsiveness is important</h5>
                <p>In building the style and design of my new webpage I learnt about the importance of the page being responsive to any device being used.</p>
                <p>A responsive site adapts in it's size to fit onto the screen of any device so that it is more user-friendly.</p>
            <h5> What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h5>
                <p>Mobile first design is beginning with the smallest screen size and device function.</p>
                <p>Once the mobile design is created it will just need a few changes added on working towards the desktop size and functions.</p>
                <p>It's important to design for mobile users first as it is the most common way of accessing the internet.</p>
                <p>A mobile device functions differently to a desktop and it's layout will need to follow a different pattern with most important information first.</p>
            <h5> What are frameworks and their pros and cons?</h5>
                <p>A framework is a basic structure to build upon in creating a web page or application. </p>
                <p>Pros.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list">It's reusable</li>
                        <li class="list">Makes the process of building a site easier</li>
                        <li class="list">It saves time</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Cons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list">It can add more time for your page to load</li>
                        <li class="list">New features can be added by the owner of the framework that may affect your site.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h5> What is a wireframe and why we use it.</h5>
                    <p>A wireframe is a blueprint design of what you want the page to do and look like.</p> 
                    <p>Here are my wireframe examples:</p>
