        <h1>Design to Web Journey</h1>
        <p>Phase-0</p>
        <p>In building the style and design of my new webpage I learnt about the importance of the page being responsive to any device being used.</p>
        <p>A responsive site adapts in it's size to fit onto the screen of any device so that it is more user-friendly.</p>
        <p>Mobile first design is beginning with the smallest screen size and device function.</p>
        <p>Once the mobile design is created it will just need a few changes added on working towards the desktop size and functions.</p>
        <p>A framework is a basic structure to build upon in creating a web page or application. </p>
        <p>Pros - reusable, makes the process of building a site easier, saves time.</p>
        <p>Cons - not too sure of any yet.</p>
        <p><img src="images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
            A wireframe is a blueprint design of what you want the page to do and look like.</p>  
        <p><img src="images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
            These are my wireframes for this website.</p>
        <p>The aspect I found difficult was making the page responsive when I just wanted to have an image as the background.</p>
        <p>I found that I didn't need a header or footer and created buttons as they were more appealing.</p>
        <p>The next hurdle will be creating links from the buttons to the pages.</p>
